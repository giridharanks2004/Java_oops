Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, is a symbol of perseverance in the face of failure.
From being a reckless billionaire to becoming a selfless hero,
his journey is marked by constant setbacks—being kidnapped,
facing the consequences of his own weapons, and enduring personal losses.
Yet, Tony never gives up. Instead of being defeated by failure, 
he learns from it, building better suits, becoming more responsible, 
and always rising stronger. Even when the odds are against him, 
like during the battle with Thanos, Tony pushes forward with courage and determination. 
His ultimate sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame shows how his perseverance wasn’t just about survival 
it was about making a difference, 
no matter the cost.
